# Prework repository for Front-End bootcamp.

## Description

This project is a Prework Study Guide. It was created for bootcamp students to help them store notes whilst going through the Prework modules. The guide contains notes on HTML, CSS, Git and Javascript.

During the building of this project we learnt the basics of HTML, CSS. We also learnt GitHub workflow, including the creating of issues and merging code through pull requests. Finally we added JavaScript to the project in the form of variables and functions.
